      Automatic parking is an autonomous car-maneuvering system that moves a
      vehicle from a traffic lane into a parking spot to perform parallel,
      perpendicular, or angle parking. The automatic parking system aims to
      enhance the comfort and safety of driving in constrained environments
      where much attention and experience is required to steer the car. The
      parking maneuver is achieved by means of coordinated control of the
      steering angle and speed which takes into account the actual situation in
      the environment to ensure collision-free motion within the available
      space.The car is an example of a nonholonomic system where the number of
      control commands available is less than the number of coordinates that
      represent its position and orientation. One of the first assistance
      systems for car parking was manual. It used four jacks with wheels to
      raise the car and then move it sideways into the available parking space.
      This mechanical system was proposed in 1934, but was never offered on any
      production model.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    <h1>Development</h1>
    <p>
      One of the world's first experimental prototypes of automatic parallel
      parking was developed on an electric car Ligier at INRIA in the
      mid-1990s. The underlying technology has been adopted by major
      automobile manufacturers offering an automatic parking option in their
      cars today. The automatic parallel parking algorithm localizes a
      sufficient parking place along the roadside, attains a convenient start
      location for the car in front of the parking place, and performs a
      parallel parking maneuver. Automatic pulling out involves localizing an
      available space for the car motion within the parking place, placing the
      car at an appropriate spot at the rear of the parking place, and
      performing a maneuver to pull out of the parking place into the traffic
      lane. The key concept behind automatic parking is to plan and
      parameterize the basic control profiles of steering angle and speed in
      order to achieve the desired shape of the vehicle's path within the
      available space. The parking maneuver is performed as a sequence of
      controlled motions using sensor data from the car servo systems and range
      measurements about the environment. The steering and velocity controls are
      computed in real time and executed. The approach results in various path
      shapes required to perform parking maneuvers. In 1992, Volkswagen
      proposed an automatic parking technology using four-wheel steering in its
      IRVW (Integrated Research Volkswagen) Futura concept car, allowing it to
      move sideward for parallel parking. However, no commercial version of this
      technology was ever offered. The idea of four-wheel steering has been
      revisited in an electric vehicle ROboMObil of the German Aerospace Center.
      The vehicle stops in front of an empty parking spot and re-orients its
      four wheels in the perpendicular direction (leaving rubber marks on the
      road) to prepare for subsequent sideward motion. In 2004, a group of
      Link√∂ping University students working with Volvo developed a project
      Evolve. The Evolve car can automatically perform parallel parking by using
      sensors and a computer to control steering, acceleration and braking of
      Volvo S60. An automatic parking system uses various methods to detect
      objects around the vehicle. Sensors installed on the front and rear
      bumpers can act as both a transmitter and a receiver. These sensors emit a
      signal that will be reflected back when it encounters an obstacle near the
      vehicle. Then, the car will use the time of flight to determine the
      position of the obstacle. Other systems use cameras, e.g. Omniview
      technology, or radars to detect obstacles and measure the parking space
      size and distance from the roadside. An automatic parking system has
      been shown to improve comfort and safety by reducing the level of stress
      people feel when manual steering for parallel parking and garage parking
      maneuvers.
