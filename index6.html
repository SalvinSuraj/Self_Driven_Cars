      Adaptive cruise control (ACC) is an available cruise control advanced
      driver-assistance system for road vehicles that automatically adjusts the
      vehicle speed to maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead. As of 2019,
      it is also called by 20 unique names that describe that basic
      functionality. This is also known as Dynamic cruise control. Control is
      based on sensor information from on-board sensors. Such systems may use a
      radar or laser sensor or a camera setup allowing the vehicle to brake when
      it detects the car is approaching another vehicle ahead, then accelerate
      when traffic allows it to. ACC technology is widely regarded as a key
      component of future generations of intelligent cars. They impact driver
      safety and convenience as well as increasing road capacity by maintaining
      optimal separation between vehicles and reducing driver errors. Vehicles
      with autonomous cruise control are considered a Level 1 autonomous car, as
      defined by SAE International. When combined with another driver assist
      feature such as lane centering, the vehicle is considered a Level 2
      autonomous car. Adaptive cruise control does not provide full autonomy:
      the system only provides some help to the driver, but does not drive the
      car by itself.

      Laser-based systems do not detect and track vehicles in adverse weather
      conditions nor do they reliably track dirty (and therefore non-reflective)
      vehicles. Laser-based sensors must be exposed, the sensor (a fairly large
      black box) is typically found in the lower grille, offset to one side.
      Radar-based sensors can be hidden behind plastic fascias; however, the
      fascias may look different from a vehicle without the feature. For
      example, Mercedes-Benz packages the radar behind the upper grille in the
      center and behind a solid plastic panel that has painted slats to simulate
      the look of the rest of the grille. Single radar systems are the most
      common. Systems involving multiple sensors use either two similar hardware
      sensors like the 2010 Audi A8 or the 2010 Volkswagen Touareg, or
      one central long range radar coupled with two short radar sensors placed
      on the corners of the vehicle like the BMW 5 and 6 series. A more
      recent development is the binocular computer vision system, such as that
      introduced to the US market in model year 2013 by Subaru. These systems
      have front-facing video cameras mounted on either side of the rear view
      mirror and use digital processing to extract depth information from the
      parallax between the two cameras' views. Assisting systems Radar-based ACC
      is often sold together with a precrash system, which warns the driver
      and/or provides brake support if there is a high risk of a collision. Also
      in certain cars, it is incorporated with a lane maintaining system which
      provides a power steering assist to reduce steering input burden on
      corners when the cruise control system is activated. Multi-sensor systems
      Systems with multiple sensors can practice sensor fusion to integrate the
      data to improve safety and/or driving experience. GPS data can inform the
      system of geographic features such as a freeway offramp. A camera system
      could notice driver behavior such as brake lights and/or a turn signal.
      This could allow the following car to interpret a turn signal by an exit
      as not requiring the following car to slow down, as the leading car will
      exit.[30] Multi-sensor systems could also take note of traffic
      signs/signals and not, e.g., violate a red light while following a vehicle
      that crossed before the signal changed. Predictive systems Predictive
      systems modify vehicle speed based on predictions of other vehicles'
      behavior. Such systems can make earlier, more moderate adjustments to the
      predicted behavior, improving safety and passenger comfort. One example is
      to predict the likelihood of a vehicle in a neighbouring lane moving in
      front of the controlled vehicle. One system predicts a lane change up to
      five seconds before it occurs. Regulations and norms.
