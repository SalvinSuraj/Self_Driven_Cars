      A collision avoidance system (CAS), also known as a pre-crash system,
      forward collision warning system, or collision mitigation system, is an
      advanced driver-assistance system designed to prevent or reduce the
      severity of a collision.In its basic form, a forward collision warning
      system monitors a vehicle's speed, the speed of the vehicle in front of
      it, and the distance between the vehicles, so that it can provide a
      warning to the driver if the vehicles get too close, potentially helping
      to avoid a crash.Various technologies and sensors that are used include
      radar (all-weather) and sometimes laser (LIDAR) and cameras (employing
      image recognition) to detect an imminent crash. GPS sensors can detect
      fixed dangers such as approaching stop signs through a location
      database.Pedestrian detection can also be a feature of these types of
      systems. Collision avoidance systems range from widespread systems
      mandatory in some countries, such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB) in
      the EU, agreements between car makers and safety officials to make crash
      avoidance systems eventually standard, such as in the United States, to
      research projects including some manufacturer specific devices. For
      complete information on Collision Avoidance system you can look up, patent

      Advanced emergency braking system (AEBS) (also automated emergency braking
      in some jurisdictions) is defined by UN ECE regulation 131 as: a system
      which can automatically detect a potential forward collision and activate
      the vehicle braking system to decelerate the vehicle with the purpose of
      avoiding or mitigating a collision.UN ECE regulation 152 says
      deceleration can be 5 metres per second squared.Once an impending
      collision is detected, these systems provide a warning to the driver. When
      the collision becomes imminent, they can take action autonomously without
      any driver input (by braking or steering or both). Collision avoidance by
      braking is appropriate at low vehicle speeds (e.g. below 50 km/h (31
      mph)), while collision avoidance by steering may be more appropriate at
      higher vehicle speeds if lanes are clear.Cars with collision
      avoidance may also be equipped with adaptive cruise control, using the
      same forward-looking sensors. AEB differs from forward collision warning:
      FCW alerts the driver with a warning but does not by itself brake the
      vehicle. According to Euro NCAP, AEB has three characteristics:
      Autonomous: the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or
      mitigate the accident. Emergency: the system will intervene only in a
      critical situation. Braking: the system tries to avoid the accident by
      applying the brakes. Time-to-collision could be a way to choose which
      avoidance method (braking or steering) is most appropriate.Collision
      avoidance system by steering is a new concept. It is considered by some
      research projects.Collision avoidance system by steering has some
      limitations: over-dependence on lane markings, sensor limitations, and
      interaction between driver and system.
