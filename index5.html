      In road-transport terminology, a lane departure warning system (LDWS) is a
      mechanism designed to warn the driver when the vehicle begins to move out
      of its lane (unless a turn signal is on in that direction) on freeways and
      arterial roads. These systems are designed to minimize accidents by
      addressing the main causes of collisions: driver error, distractions and
      drowsiness. In 2009 the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
      Administration (NHTSA) began studying whether to mandate lane departure
      warning systems and frontal collision warning systems on automobiles.
      There are three types of systems: Systems which warn the driver if the
      vehicle is leaving its lane with visual, audible, and/or vibration
      warnings (lane departure warning, LDW) Systems which warn the driver and,
      with no response, automatically take steps to ensure the vehicle stays in
      its lane (lane keeping assist, LKA/LKS) Systems which assist in
      oversteering, keeping the car centered in the lane, and asking the driver
      to take over in challenging situations (lane centering assist, LCA)
      Another system is the emergency lane keeping (ELK). The emergency lane
      keeping applies correction to a vehicle which drift beyond a solid lane
      marking.

    <h1>Working Principle</h1>

      A lane detection system used behind the lane departure warning system uses
      the principle of Hough transform and Canny edge detector to detect lane
      lines from realtime camera images fed from the front-end camera of the
      automobile. A basic flowchart of how a lane detection algorithm works to
      help lane departure warning is shown in the figures.

    <h1>Limitations</h1>

    <p>
      Lane departure warning systems and lane keeping systems rely on visible
      lane markings. They typically cannot decipher faded, missing, or incorrect
      lane markings. Markings covered in snow or old lane markings left visible
      can hinder the ability of the system. UNECE regulation 130 does not
      require LDWS of heavy vehicles to work under 60 km/h or to work in a curve
      with a radius lower than 250 meters. Lane departure warning systems
      also face many legal limitations regarding autonomous driving. As stated
      previously, this system requires constant driver input. Vehicles with this
      technology are limited to assisting the driver, not driving the vehicle.
      Lane departure warning systems biggest limitation is that it is not in
      complete control of the vehicle. The system does not take into account
      other vehicles on the road and "cannot replace good driving habits".
